Dataset using: Movie Lens 100k.

1. The dataset contains 3 dataframe: users, movies and ratings.
2. The project's goal is using current ratings from RATINGS DATAFRAME to predict ratings for all movies from all user.

How to use:
1. Clone my git and put everything on your Google Drive.
2. Open "Recommandation System using MF and NCF .ipynb" using Google Colab.
3. Go to the last session "Load pretrained models" to load pretrained models and weights (Have tutorials inside)
